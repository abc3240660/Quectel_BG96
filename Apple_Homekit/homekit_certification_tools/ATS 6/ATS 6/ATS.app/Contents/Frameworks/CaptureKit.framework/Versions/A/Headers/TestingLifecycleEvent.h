/**
 TestingLifecycleEvent is a class. Subclass of ATSAppEvent. It's usage is for
 when testing lifecycle messages need to be presented to the user.
 
 ie. "Test Case "HID message validation" has started/stoped"
 
 Some interesting logic can be used on these events. The above declared enums
 give identity cues that can make it easier.
 
 The "visible to the user" part of this event will be generated based on entity
 type, signal type and source. It will be accompanied by an identifier for the 
 entity and by an optional description provided to the event on initialization.
 
 For context events that need to be analyzed. The ContextEvent class is what you
 want.
