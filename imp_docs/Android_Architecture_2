---------------
1)Linux Kernel:
----------------
-Architecture is based on Linux 2.6 kernel.
-Used linux Kernel as H/W abstraction layer.
-Provides driver model for existing hardwares.
-provides security model,process management, memory management, Networking.
-written in pure c.

-------------------
2)Native Libraries:
-------------------
-written in c/c++.
-Lot of the core power of android platform comes from.

-Surface Manager:
 ----------------
 -responsible for composing different drawing surfaces onto the screen.
 -Responsible for taking different windows owned by different applications those r running in different processes all drawing in different 
  times and making sure that pixle end up on the screen when they r supposed to.

-OpenGLES & SGL:
 -------------
 -These 2 makes cores for graphics library.
 -OpenGLES is a 3d graphics library. We have s/w implementation which is hw acceleratable if the device has 3d chip on it.
-SGL graphics are for 2d graphics.

-Media framework:
-----------------
-provided by packet video one of the members of the open handset alliance contains all of the codecs for the media experience.
-mpeg4,h264,mp3,aac all the video codex are available for building rich media experience.

-Freetype:
----------
-Render our fonts.

-SQLite:
--------
-Core of all data storage.

-webkit:
---------
-open source browsing engine.
-Used as core of the browsers.


------------------
3)Android Runtime:
------------------ 
-Main component is dalvik virtual machine.
-specificially deveoped for android to meet the need of running into embedded environment where u have limited battery, limited environment
 & limited cpu.
-Dalvik virtual machine(DVM) runs .dex file.
-.dex files are the byte codes those are the results of converting at build time .class and .jar files. These files when they converts to
 .dex file run smoothly on small processor.
-.dex files use memory very efficiently. datastructures are designed to be shared across processes whenever possible & uses highly cpu byte
 code interpreter.

-Core Libraries:
-----------------
-This is written in java programming languages.
-contains utilities, io, collection classes and tools.

------------------------
4)Application framework:
------------------------
-written in java programming language.
-Toolkits that all applications use.

-Activity manager:
------------------
-Manages life cycles of applications.
-Maintains a common backstack so that applications running in different processess can have smoothly integrated navigation experience.

-package manager:
-----------------
-keeps tracks of which application is installed on the device.
-If you download new application in the air or install the application package manager is responsible for keeping track what u have and 
 what are the capabilities of each of the applications.

-window manager:
----------------
-Manages windows java programming language abstraction on top of the lower level services that are provided by surface manager.


-Telephony manager:
-------------------
-Contains APIs to build phone application i.e central to phone experience.

-Content provider:
-------------------
-unique piece of android platform. 
-allows to share data of one application with others.
-Used in the contact application where informations are shared with other application.

-Resource Manager:
------------------
Used to store localized string bit maps and layout file descriptions all of the external part of the application.

-View System:
-------------
-Contains buttons and lists all the building blocks pf an UI.

-------------
5)Apllication:
-------------
-Contact, phone , browser etc.
